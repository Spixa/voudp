## Things related to audio
* Add real jitter buffering
* Add packet reordering
* Add packet loss concealment (PLC)
* Implement in-band FEC
* Do time-aligned mixing
* Add deterministic clock

## Other high priority features after audio:
* Implement the color command for selecting own color in chat
* Add client-side noisegate feature 

## Encryption overhaul
* Add proper handshake instead of checking if encryption fails
* Use RSA4096 to do a [openSIMP](https://github.com/spixa/opensimp)-like handshake
* Swap key derivation for individual keys generated by the server for each user
* Remove masking entirely and swap it for authentication
* This step will be done by the handshake process, too exactly like [openSIMP](https://github.com/spixa/opensimp)'s [spec](https://github.com/Spixa/openSIMP/blob/main/specs/handshake.md)

## Misc features
* Implement all commands that are currently in the command list
* Add networking telemetry
